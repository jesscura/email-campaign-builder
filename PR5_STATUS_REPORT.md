## Known Issues & Notes

### 1. Database Connection Warning (Non-blocking)
During build, the `/api/plans` route attempts to connect to the database. This generates a warning:
```
Error fetching plans: PrismaClientInitializationError: 
Can't reach database server at `localhost:5432`
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Expected behavior - does NOT fail the build
**Explanation:** Next.js pre-renders API routes during build time. Since no database is available at build time, this error is logged but the build continues and completes successfully. This is standard for Next.js apps with database dependencies.

### 2. Vercel Deployment Failures
The PR shows Vercel deployment failures for both projects (email-builder and email-campaign-builder).

**Likely Causes:**
- Missing environment variables in Vercel project settings
- DATABASE_URL not configured in Vercel
- Stripe keys not configured
- NextAuth secret not set

**Resolution Required:**
- Configure all environment variables from `.env.example` in Vercel project settings
- Set up a production database (Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Neon.tech)
- Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in Vercel build settings
- Set up Stripe webhook endpoints

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
```
35 vulnerabilities (1 low, 3 moderate, 31 high)
```

**Analysis:** These are primarily in development dependencies and transitive dependencies. Many are related to older versions of:
- `eslint@8.57.1` (deprecated, should upgrade to v9)
- `rimraf@3.0.2` (deprecated)
- `inflight@1.0.6` (deprecated, memory leak)

**Recommendation:** Run `npm audit fix` and review breaking changes, or upgrade major dependencies like ESLint to v9.

### 4. prisma.config.ts Removed
The `prisma.config.ts` file was causing build failures by requiring DATABASE_URL at load time. 

**Action Taken:** Removed the file to allow builds without a database connection.
**Impact:** Minimal - Prisma still works correctly using `prisma/schema.prisma` directly.
