## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (to make app functional)
1. **API Integration**: Connect UI to backend API endpoints
   - Campaigns API module (CRUD operations)
   - Contacts API module (import, list, segment)
   - Analytics API module (metrics aggregation)

2. **State Management**: Add client state for:
   - Campaign builder blocks
   - Audience filter rules
   - Analytics date range selection

3. **Real Data Display**:
   - Replace placeholder "0" counts with actual data from API
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement data fetching with React Query or SWR

### Medium Term (feature completion)
1. **AI Campaign Builder**:
   - Drag-and-drop block editor
   - Subject line suggestions (OpenAI)
   - Layout optimizer
   - A/B test variant generator

2. **Audience Segmentation**:
   - Dynamic segment builder UI
   - Nested rule conditions
   - Real-time count estimates

3. **Analytics Dashboards**:
   - Chart components (recharts or similar)
   - Time-range selector
   - Campaign comparison
   - Predictive metrics

4. **Settings Functionality**:
   - Profile update form
   - Password change with validation
   - 2FA setup (TOTP QR code)
   - Workspace member invitation
   - Stripe billing portal integration

### Long Term (polish)
1. Real-time updates (WebSocket for campaign status)
2. Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
3. Mobile-responsive improvements
4. Onboarding tour for new users
5. Empty state illustrations
